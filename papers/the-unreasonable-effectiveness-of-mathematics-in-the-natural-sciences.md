# The unreasonable effectiveness of mathematics in the natural sciences

> The first reason that it is surprising is that it is true not only in Pisa, and in Galileo’s time, it is true everywhere on the Earth, was always true, and will always be true.

Laws of physics are true everywhere, have always been and always will be true. This *invariance* allows to do physics at all.

> The second surprising feature is that the regularity which we are discussing is independent of so many conditions which could have an effect on it

Just a few factors impact the described behavior. 

> The preceding discussion is intended to remind us, first, that it  is not at all natural that "laws of nature" exist, much less that man is able to discover them.


> [E.  Schrodinger, in his What Is Life?(Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 1945), p. 31, says that this second miracle may well be beyond human understanding.]

I think that's a bit arrogant. How can we know we *actually* understand the laws of nature? We sure can make some predictions, but that doesn't mean we understand the governing rules. In a game of chess, one could predict that the bishop will always be on the same color throughout the entire game, *and be right* (hence conclude he has found a law of nature). Yet, this would have been without understanding the *governing* law, the direction of the movement. So, is it a miracle that we are able to find patterns?

> The principal purpose of the preceding discussion is to point out that the laws of nature are all conditional statements and they relate only to a  very small part of our knowledge of the world.

> It should be mentioned, for the sake of accuracy, that we discovered about thirty years ago that even the conditional statements cannot be entirely precise [...] They [discovered laws of nature] do not allow us to make categorical statements, not even categorical statements conditional on the present state of the world

That second part is interesting. Even if we knew our current state *perfectly*, it says there would be no way to *exactly* predict the future. Is that quantum mechanics? It then talks about the nuclear reactors, so probably.

> It is not true, however,as is so often stated, that this had to happen because mathematics uses the simplest possible concepts and these were bound to occur in any formalism. [followed by an argument through an example]

I'm not convinced by the argument. It just says "the key fits in the door lock so perfectly that the door must have been designed for the key". There are a bunch of coincidences, but that doesn't constitute a proof.

> The observation which comes closest to an explanation forthe mathematical concepts’ cropping up in physics which I  know is Einstein’s statement that theonly physical theories which we are willing to accept are the beautiful ones

> A possible explanation of the physicist’s use of mathematics to formulate his laws of nature is that he is a  somewhat irresponsible person. As a  result, when he finds a  connection between two quantities which resembles a  connection well-known from mathematics, he will jump at the
conclusion that the connection is that discussed in mathematics simply because he does not know of any other similar connection. It is not the intention of the present discussion to refute the charge that the physicist is a  somewhat irresponsible person. Perhaps he is.

I think he is.

Just to use the same example as above. Mathematics might be analogous to our ability to see color. Hence, we can predict the bishop's behavior with great accuracy. On the other hand, some other language, which could very possibly outside of human reach, could be analogous to the governing rule: a bishop only moves in diagonal. Hence great accuracy doesn't mean in any way perfect understanding.

So, how can we prove that we have a perfect understanding. If one has a perfect understanding of the physical world, does that mean he understands everything? Assuming the positive, then that means that he will be able to predict everything. Prediction isn't going to be a proof either though, because how could we know that it wasn't luck? Just being statically significant doesn't guarantee that there isn't some God playing a trick on us. Another problems comes with energy. Maybe one *does* understand everything, but prediction requires more energy than he can conjure, hence isn't able to "prove" his claim.

> Surely in this case we "got something out" of the equations that we did not put in.

That's a good sentence to argue that a language, mathematics, is THE language.

Can you get something out which you did not put in if the medium isn't a exactly THE medium. I agree that it has to be related, somewhat. But that doesn't prove that it is THE medium I think.

> The level of knowledge and ingenuity is a  continuous variable and it  is unlikelythat a  relatively small variation of this continuous variable changes the attainable picture of theworld from inconsistent to consistent

What? No! Unless you call a ahah moment on large variation, that's exactly what a small change in our "level of intelligence" does.
