# Encryption

## Common attacks

- brute force
- replay attack
- frequency analysis

## Theory

> *Kerchkoff's principle* states that an encryption algorithm should not require to
be secret.

> *Steganography*: hide message (alter least significant bits in image/audio files,
use delays on a network, etc)

### Attacks on protocols

- *Passive*: the attacker listens to the connection, but doesn't alter
  anything
- *Active*: attacker changes the protocol (new messages, modifying or
  deleting existing messages, etc)
