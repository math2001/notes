# Lithium batteries (LIB)

Anode: positive electrode
Cathode: negative electrode

During charging, an external electrical power source (the charging circuit)
applies an over-voltage (a higher voltage than the battery produces, of the
same polarity), forcing a charging current to flow within the battery from the
positive to the negative electrode, i.e. in the reverse direction of a
discharge current under normal conditions. The lithium ions then migrate from
the positive to the negative electrode, where they become embedded in the
porous electrode material in a process known as intercalation. (1)

Energy losses arising from electrical contact resistance at interfaces between
electrode layers and at contacts with current-collectors can be as high as 20%
of the entire energy flow of batteries under typical operating conditions. (1)

## Temperature impact on battery life

Charging temperature limits for Li-ion are stricter than the operating limits.
Lithium-ion chemistry performs well at elevated temperatures but **prolonged
exposure to heat reduces battery life** (1).

Li-ion batteries provide lightweight, high energy density power sources for a
variety of devices. To power larger devices, such as electric cars, connecting
many small batteries in a parallel circuit is more effective and more efficient
than connecting a single large battery. (1)

## Self discharge

Batteries gradually self-discharge even if not connected and delivering
current. Li+ rechargeable batteries have a self-discharge rate typically stated
by manufacturers to be 1.5-2% per month. (1)

## Degradation depends on temperature

Degradation is strongly temperature-dependent, with a minimal degradation
around 25 °C, i.e., increasing if stored or used at above or below 25 °C (1)
